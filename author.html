                Colin is a Computer Science student in his seniorish/super super senior year at Wayne State University.
                His planned graduation date is December 2022. After this semester, he needs to complete: Computer Operating Sytems + Lab,
                Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science, two Computer Science Electives, and since he loves physics so much, University Physics for Engineers II.
                Once Colin finishes those classes, he will complete his Senior Project which will allow him to shift his focus on his ultimate goal: World Domination.
                If World Domination does not work out, he will continue to watch sports, exercise, write bios, and try to get better in his computer career.
